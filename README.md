# Agora

Welcome to the Agora repository, an integral part of the Odysseia-Greek project. Drawing inspiration from the ancient Greek Agora, a central public space known for its vibrant gatherings and communal activities, this repository serves as the cornerstone of our microservices architecture. Just as the historical Agoras were the heartbeat of Greek city-states, centralizing commerce, conversation, and civic life, this repository centralizes and harmonizes our diverse array of APIs and shared services.

## Repository Overview
Agora is designed to be the foundational layer that connects various microservices and components within the Odysseia-Greek project. It houses essential interfaces and common layers, including but not limited to Kubernetes, Elastic, Queue, and Common interfaces. Each of these components is a vital cog in the larger mechanism of our project, enabling seamless integration and efficient functionality across different services.

## Features
Modular Design: Each interface within Agora is encapsulated as a separate package, complete with its own go.mod, allowing for independent versioning and release cycles.
Centralized Interfaces: Agora unifies essential interfaces and layers, facilitating easy access and standardization across our microservices.
Scalable and Maintainable: With a focus on scalability and maintainability, Agora is structured to support the evolving needs of the Odysseia-Greek project.
